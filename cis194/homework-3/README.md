# CIS 194, Homework #3

- [lecture](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures/03-rec-poly.html)
- [assignment](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/hw/03-rec-poly.pdf)

### Notes

If you would like to play code golf with the assignment, do so with **word** count rather
than **character** count. This way, a variable named `tally` and another named `x` have
the same golf score, though the former carries significantly more meaning.

Also, remember that you may import any libraries included in the [Haskell Platform][1]!
